  \WorkExperience
{2016-current}
{Data Scientist / Portfolio Analyst}
{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed analytic tools, models, and software to process the natural language of text using distributional embeddings (e.g. word2vec) over the NIH grants and publication corpus.
    \item Analyzed grant and publication portfolios, evaluating metrics such as clinical impact, technological impact, and award rates to build quantitative comparisons between various populations.
    \item Architected and productionized machine learning models for classification, regression, outlier detection, and language modeling. Maintained several open-source tools used internationally.
    \item Restored historical texts from books, records, and PDFs into actionable data.
  \end{itemize}
}

 
\WorkExperience
{2014-2016}
{Postdoctoral Fellowship at National Institutes of Health}
{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Researched novel integration schemes for molecular dynamics simulations. Developed protein models for tertiary structure prediction from primary sequence.
  \item Worked in collaboration with experimentalists to test and validate models. 
  \end{itemize}
}

\WorkExperience
{2011-2014}
{Postdoctoral Fellowship at National Institutes of Health}
{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed multi-scale theoretical and computational models to study protein folding, structure, and protein-protein. Derived hard-sphere models to account for crowding in biomolecular simulations and potentials to model anisotropic charge distributions.
  \item Managed large-scale parallel projects (1000+ cores) to simulate the cellular environment.
  \end{itemize}
}

\WorkExperience
{2005-2011}
{Teaching Assistant (Drexel)}

  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Scientific team leader for a novel interagency government blockchain to detect grant duplication with minimal shared data. Coordinated research, oversaw design, and developed protocols within the NIH and NSF teams.

    \item Developed new analytic tools to process the text of NIH grants and publications using distributional embeddings (word2vec) and transformers (BERT). Tools were deployed for analysis presented to NIH senior leadership, Congress, and publications in high-ranking journals.

    \item Architected and productionized machine learning models for classification, regression, outlier detection, and language modeling. Creator and maintainer of several open-source tools used internationally in the scientific community.

      \item Trained and mentored junior staff in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
  
  \item Analyzed grant and publication portfolios, evaluating metrics such as clinical impact, technological impact, and award rates to build quantitative comparisons between various populations.
    
  \item Restored historical texts from books and generated new structured data from free text. Expanded NIH grant coverage by thirty years from archival documents. Cross-linked publications to an NIH application's biographical sketch and literature cited. Data used internally with the NIH for analysis on racial disparity, topic analysis, mentorship, and grant efficacy.
